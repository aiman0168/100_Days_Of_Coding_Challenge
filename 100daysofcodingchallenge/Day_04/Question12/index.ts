//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
let names = ['Alishba', 'Amna', 'Ayesha', 'Shaiqa'];
for (let name of names){
    console.log(`Hello! ${name} thinking of you today, hope you have a good morning.`);
}
